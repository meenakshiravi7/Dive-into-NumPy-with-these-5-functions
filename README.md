# Dive-into-NumPy-with-these-5-functions

NumPy is one of the most widely used libraries in Python. We can use NumPy to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays that are simply much more efficient and quick than traditional Python code. Here we are going to see some working examples and few breaking examples of 5 Numpy functions to have more clarity about the functions.

- np.random
- np.where
- np.linspace
- np.sort
- np.nan

For each of these functions, we have made 2 working cases and one breaking case and how to overcome it.
